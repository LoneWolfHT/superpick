# Superpick - a mod for Minetest

by everamzah

This mod adds a special pick that you can mine any block with.

> *It's very fast! Originally inspired by Calinou's maptool's admin pickaxe. It uses a Mese pickaxe texture with an obsidian shard overlay. The appearance will change according to texture pack. This pick will dig anything instantly, even if what you're trying to dig has defined `on_punch`.*
